post in an attempt to obtain karma. Your attempt will not work. Here is why it won't work. (One or more of the following may apply to your particular post, and it may have other flaws which used to vary from topic to topic.)

(x) Posts like yours are getting old an tired, and quite frankly we're sick of them
(x) Your User Id is too high
( ) It just isn't funny enough
(x) Funny mods don't give karma

Specifically, your post fails to cater to

( ) Anything relevant to the story
(x) Extreme stupidity on the part of moderators
( ) Extensive research into the topic

and the following philosophical objections may also apply:

( ) Posts similar to yours are easy to come up with, yet none have ever been highly moderated
( ) That's a common troll that has never been verified
(x) You obviously haven't read the article
(x) You haven't even read the summary
( ) Or the headline
( ) Killing you that way is not slow and painful enough

Furthermore, this is what I think about you:

( ) Sorry dude, but I don't think it would work.
(x) This is a stupid post, and you're a stupid person for posting it.
( ) Nice try, assh0le! I'm going to find out where you live and burn your
house down!
