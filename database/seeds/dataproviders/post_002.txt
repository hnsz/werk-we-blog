ParcelHero has entered the Financial Times’ FT 1000 list of Europe’s fastest growing companies, breaking straight into the top 500 at 497.

The FT 1000, compiled with Statista, lists the European companies that achieved the highest compound annual growth rate in revenue between 2014 and 2017.

ParcelHero’s founder and MD, Roger Sumner Rivers, says: ‘We’re delighted to be included in this inspiring list of companies that have demonstrated exceptional growth in recent years.’

The annual FT 1000 ranking is now in its third year. The hurdle to securing a place was a little higher this year: the bottom-ranked company achieved a growth rate of 37.7 per cent, compared with 34.6 per cent last year.

ParcelHero was entered in its Technology Sector. The FT 1000 continues to be dominated by technology companies, which account for 149 of the businesses listed.

ParcelHero is one of the British companies helping to fly the flag against a growing German lion’s share of the listing. 230 German companies made it into the FT 1000 this year, while London remains the top city, with 63 businesses based there.
